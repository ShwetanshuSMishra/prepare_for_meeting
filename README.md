# Project Overview

This is a CrewAI project, designed to assist in managing and preparing for business meetings. This involves several autonomous agents working together to achieve a common goal â€” optimizing meeting preparation through automation and intelligence.

## Features

- **Autonomous Agents:** Each agent specializes in a particular aspect of meeting preparation:
  - **Researcher:** Gathers information on meeting participants and associated companies.
  - **Industry Analyst:** Analyzes relevant industry trends.
  - **Meeting Strategist:** Develops the agenda and key talking points.
  - **Brief Writer:** Compiles a comprehensive meeting brief.

- **Task Automation:** Systematic completion of tasks ranging from participant research to the generation of meeting briefs.

- **Tool Integration:** Utilizes a custom toolset, allowing agents to perform web searches and data analysis effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **CrewAI Framework:** Leveraged to design and implement the functionality of autonomous agents.
- **Python:** Primary programming language used for scripting and automation.
